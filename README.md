VoidArch-CSharp
===============

A proper C# test implementation of the void VM platform
Includes a WIP C# implementation of MekaX, a programming language designed for the void platform, 
targetted at the development of low level applications in a JIT environment

The goal is to create a version of the VM that runs on bare metal, allowing for the development of Operating Systems
in MekaX using its strict type checking and VM security measures.
